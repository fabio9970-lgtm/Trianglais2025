# Language Academy Landing Page Blueprint

## Project Goal

Create a minimalist and modern static landing page for a language academy offering courses in English, French, and Spanish. The page will serve as an online presence to showcase the academy and attract potential students.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5:** For semantic page structure, utilizing custom elements (Web Components) for reusability where appropriate.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and layout. Will leverage modern features like Flexbox, Grid, CSS variables, and potentially subtle keyframe animations. Focus on clean design, ample whitespace, and a limited color palette.
*   **JavaScript (ES Modules):** Pure JavaScript for any necessary interactive elements, such as smooth scrolling or simple form validation (if a contact form is included). No external frameworks will be used to keep the page lightweight and minimalist.

## Design Principles

*   **Minimalism:** Clean lines, uncluttered layout, and focus on essential content.
*   **Modern Typography:** Use carefully selected fonts to enhance readability and convey a modern aesthetic.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout will adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries and flexible units.
*   **Subtle Animations:** Incorporate subtle, non-intrusive animations to add visual interest and improve user experience (e.g., fade-in on scroll, hover effects).
*   **Limited Color Palette:** Use a restrained color scheme to maintain a clean and sophisticated look.

## Page Structure and Sections

1.  **Hero Section:**
    *   Prominent headline clearly stating the academy's purpose (e.g., "Learn English, French, or Spanish").
    *   Concise subheading or brief description of the academy's approach or benefits.
    *   Clear Call-to-Action (CTA) button (e.g., "Explore Courses," "Contact Us").
    *   Visually appealing background (image, gradient, or simple color block) that aligns with the minimalist design.

2.  **About Us Section:**
    *   Introduce the language academy.
    *   Highlight the academy's mission, values, or teaching philosophy.
    *   Briefly mention what sets the academy apart.

3.  **Courses Section:**
    *   Overview of the languages offered: English, French, and Spanish.
    *   A brief description for each language, perhaps highlighting key aspects of the curriculum or target audience.
    *   Avoid detailed course outlines on the landing page; direct users to contact for more information.

4.  **Contact Section:**
    *   Provide clear contact information (email address, phone number).
    *   Consider a simple contact form with minimal fields (Name, Email, Message).
    *   Include a call to action to get in touch for inquiries or enrollment.

## Implementation Notes

*   Start with the basic HTML structure in `index.html`.
*   Style the page incrementally using `style.css`, focusing on layout and typography first.
*   Add JavaScript functionality in `main.js` as needed for interactivity.
*   Ensure cross-browser compatibility and accessibility.
*   Optimize images and other assets for performance.
